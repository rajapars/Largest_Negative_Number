# Largest_Negative_Number
Given an array of integer A, write a function to find the largest negative number that not in array A.
The solution must works with standard JDK, no additional library (e.g. apache commons, guava, etc) allowed.
Example :

* A = [3, 2, -5, 0] > result is -1
* A = [10, -1, -2, -3] > result is -4
* A = [0, 2, 4, -1, -3, -4] > result is -2
